# Wordy

Wordy is a toy programming language for students in Programming Languages class to do science to. Wordy 2.0 is an improvement upon Wordy, with the addition of functions and records.


## Project setup

**Accept the assignment** in GitHub classroom. Make sure that you do not just clone the template! Check the URL of this page, and make sure the path ends with `wordy-YourGitHubUsername` and not just `wordy`.

**Clone** your assignment repository using the Git tool of your choice (such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), [GitUp](https://gitup.co), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com), or the `git` command line).

⚠️ Make sure you **clone** the repository; do not just download the zip!

⚠️ When you clone the repository, pay attention to _where_ you are cloning it on your computer’s file system. (In GitHub Desktop, you can use Repository → Show in Finder (Mac) / Repository → Show in Explorer (Windows) if you aren’t sure where you cloned it. Other Git GUIs have a similar feature.)

Now set up your development environment, using the Java development tool of your choice:

- [IntelliJ instructions](docs/setup-intellij.md)
- [Visual Studio Code instructions](docs/setup-vs-code.md)
- [Command line instructions](docs/setup-command-line.md)

Any one of these tools will work fine. Pick the one you are most comfortable with (or the one you most want to learn more about!).
